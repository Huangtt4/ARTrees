3951,"This oak is highly speculated to be one of four oak saplings given to Jesse Owens, a long-time Ohio resident and OSU graduate, for each of his four gold medals won during the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The trees were awarded by Adolf Hitler, who had planned for the Berlin Olympics to be a platform to promote Aryan supremacy and anti-semitism. Contrary to his expectations, however, Jesse Owens took home four medals that year. Evidence on the tree’s age and species, as well as history of construction on campus that would have potentially moved the tree from where Owens said he planted it, all point to this oak being one of the famous four.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This tree, also referred to as a scale tree, dates back to the Carboniferous period nearly 360 million years ago, and is believed to have actually grown in present-day central Ohio. The Carboniferous period, which means “coal-bearing” period, is an extremely important era during which many coal beds that we rely on today to fuel our coal power plants were formed. Coal plays a particularly major role in Ohio because it fuels 58% of net electricity generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5945,"These two giant sycamore trees sit at the site of the Underground Railroad. They were present then, in the 1800’s, and though they would have been smaller, their bright white bark likely helped to guide escaped African American slaves as they followed the trail taking them to safe houses in Ohio. These trees were almost bulldozed to make way for the road they now flank, but two employees at the medical center spearheaded an online petition to save them. After collecting over 1500 signatures and discussions with OSU President Gordon Gee, the trees were saved successfully. After this, it was realized that a greater effort needed to be made to protect the trees on the campus of The Ohio State University even as necessary development of campus continues. Chadwick Arboretum & Learning Gardens partnered with the university landscape architect to identify and map all of the trees on campus, with the goal of obtaining Tree Campus USA certification from the Arbor Day Foundation. The certification was achieved in 2012 and Ohio State University has continually met the required standards each year since, thanks to the active efforts of volunteers, students, faculty, and staff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
