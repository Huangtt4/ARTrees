quercus lyrata,"A rare tree in Ohio. One of the species that best survived the floods of the Mississippi River, it is capable of surviving floods even when inundated for up to 4 months."
quercus phellos,A common street tree. It has a native range from Philadelphia all the way south to Atlanta. It received its name due to the similarity of its leaves to willow leaves.
acer campestre,This tree received its name from its association with the hedgerows of Europe in World War II.
metasequoia glyptostroboides,"This majestic tree is commonly referred to as a living fossil, due to its history dating back over 100 million years. For a period it was thought to have extinct for millions of years, since only fossil records could be located. In 1944, however, an arborist from China rediscovered the species in the Sichuan province. Unlike other species in its family, the dawn redwood is deciduous and sheds its leaves in the fall. "
fagus sylvatica,"As its name suggests, this tree is native to Europe but used extensively as an ornamental in the U.S. It can be clipped to form attractive hedges, or let grow into a large tree."
quercus acutissima,"An Asian native, this tree is selected in this country for its benefit to wildlife. Unlike other oaks itproduces acorns consistently, yet does not persist into natural forests, so is not invasive."
juglans nigra,"Noted for its valuable wood, large fruit, natural dyes, abrasive cleaner from shell, and distinctive flavorful nutmeats, this tree also releases an antagonistic compound inhibiting the growth of some plants."
ginkgo biloba,"This living fossil dates back over 270 million years. Famous for its potent smell, the edible “nut” of a ginkgo is considered a delicacy in China and is believed to have many health benefits. Ginkgo has been cultivated in Chinese monasteries to the extent that all “wild trees” now found in Asia are believed to be naturalized from monastery cultivation. Six famous Gingko trees survived the atomic bomb explosion at Hiroshima and are still alive there today."
quercus muehlenbergii,"Considered to be a low-maintenance and long-living tree, the Chinkapin oak is also native to the Midwest. Its acorns are considered to be the sweetest of oaks and can even be eaten raw. "
liriodendron tulipifera,"A beautiful ornamental in the magnolia family, features spring-blooming flowers that bear a striking resemblance to tulips. Flowers are recognized for their popularity amongst pollinators, including hummingbirds and bees. Honey produced from tulip trees are prized for their rich, red color. The only known host plant for tuliptree silkmoths and one of very few host plants for tiger swallowtail caterpillars.   "
platanus occidentalis,"On OSU’s campus, the American sycamore is the only tree species capable of having been here before the creation of the university. At least one tree was here before the Ohio State University was established in 1870, possibly since the signing of the U.S. Constitution in 1787. Several large sycamore trees stood in the path of expansion of an OSU road system in 2010 and were at risk of removal, but were saved by passionate faculty and student activism. The road was eventually built with a slight curve and the two trees remain standing to this day."
quercus prinus,"A slow-growing ridge top tree with the thickest ridged, dark brown bark of Eastern oaks. The fire resistant bark protects the tree from secondary trunk decay wounds."
zelkova serrata,"An Asian introduction, was selected for its V-shape because of its similarity to the American elm. Ironically, this V-shape is incredibly sensitive to storm damage, and if hit by lightning, it rarely survives."
gleditsia triacanthos var. inermis ,"The first plant patented by Ohio nurseries in 1949. It has since been widely planted as a street tree, although it can damage sidewalks with its rooting system."
gleditsia triacanthos,"A rare tree to be found in public landscapes due to its large thorns (up to six inches!), which were used by Cherokees as weapons. Contrary to its thorny exterior, honeylocusts produce pods filled with a sweet pulp similar to honey. "
pyrus calleryana,"A hybrid originally created as an attractive ornamental which thrived nearly everywhere but produced sterile fruit, it saw immense popularity throughout the 1900s, especially in suburban areas. It was only realized later that the tree was incredibly invasive due to its ability to hybridize with other varieties and produce fertile fruit, then rapidly spreading into neighboring areas. Invasives are dangerous for a variety of reasons, primarily because native species, which are important for pollinators and wildlife, tend to be outcompeted by these hardier species. Today, the callery pear is widely targeted for removal as an invasive species due to the threats it poses to biodiversity. "
fraxinus excelsior,"A fast-growing tree commonly used for producing timber. Was found to be highly susceptible to the pervasive pest emerald ash borer (EAB), and as such was banned from several states to prevent further spread of the pest. "
picea abies,"Conifers are uncommon to central Ohio, yet this spruce is the best adapted exotic, coming from Northern Europe. It is very invasive in the Adirondack Mountains, wiping out native white spruce."
tilia euchlora,"A European hybrid, very similar to the little-leaf linden. It is widely planted as a street tree, and usually grows to a smaller height of 60 feet. Linden trees can grow very old and there are several trees in Europe that are over 1000 years old. Together with willows, they were used in medieval England for “coppicing”, the managed annual cutting of trees to produce straight branches for basketry. There is a coppice in Gloucestershire estimated to be 2,000 years old. Linden flowers are bee pollinated and are sought after by honey producers."
tilia cordata,Honey produced by bees feeding on Linden trees is prized across Europe for its nutritional and medicinal value. It is the national tree of the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic.
picea pungens,"The most common seed source for Ohio of blue spruce is in Kaibab forest, on the north rim of the Grand Canyon. The additional wax in that environment makes it salt resistant, which is key in Ohio."
gymnocladus dioicus,"The seed of this tree was used as a “poor mans coffee” during the colonial era. Coffee came by sea and was very expensive, so its seeds were roasted instead to caramelize sugars for flavor and color."
corylus colurna,Most arboreal of the filberts. The native filbert is a multi-stemmed shrub reaching only 8-10 feet. A popular choice with woodworkers.
carpinus betulus,"A prolific seeder, is often found as a shade or street tree. Dense foilage make it an excellent choice for topiary. Leaves are haemostatic (can stop bleeding) and can be harvested and dried in late summer. "
pinus strobus,"A native conifer representing both Maine and Michigan as state tree. Was valued by native tribes for its healing and antiseptic traits. Under the right conditions, can survive for well over four hundred years. "
liquidambar styraciflua,"The most popular cultivar is the Moraine sweetgum, named for a famous farm located on a moraine. One of few plants with a split range, one in Southeast US, one in Central America."
quercus macrocarpa,"Of all oaks, this one grows the largest acorn in the world, up to the size of a golf ball. Its bark can be up to 6 inches thick to protect it from natural wildfires. The name macrocarpa originates from Ancient Greek and means “large fruit”."
aesculus hippocastanum,"A European native, it is often mistaken for the Ohio buckeye. It is much more arboreal, slower to grow initially, and is said to be a better ornamental."
betula nigra,"Native to Ohio north up to Dayton, and commonly found on sandbars. It is very sensitive to iron/manganese, reflected in its coloring."
quercus robur,"A national emblem in England, this tree appears in history, songs, and on the pound coin. Prized for its beauty, lumber, and longevity, there are 1,000 year old individuals still alive in England. 1,500 year old individuals have been documented in Bulgaria and Lithuania."
sophora japonica,An East Asia native often found in temple gardens.
juglans sieboldiana,"Often used as an ornamental tree because of its distinct, decorative leaves, it also produces edible nuts and leaves which can be used to create a yellow dye."
malus sp.,"Although fruit is not commonly consumed in the US, it is edible and eaten as a sour condiment in Southeast Asia."
quercus rubra,"Tolerant to urban environmental conditions including dry or acidic soil and air pollution. The bark has medicinal qualities used for heart trouble and bronchial infections, and can also function as a cleanser, disinfectant, and astringent. Has formed a unique symbiotic relationship with Ascomycota, a type of fungi that helps to induce growth of Northern Red Oak trees."
acer saccharum,"Sap contains twice the amount of sugar as other maples, which is why they are the primary supplier in commercial syrup production. Creating 1 liter of maple syrup requires 35-40 liters of sap. Unfortunately, sugar maples are sensitive to many conditions commonly found in urban settings, such as high heat, compacted soil, air pollution, and road salt. Acid rain and stressors from the environment can lead to maple decline, a term used to describe a maple in poor health."
celtis occidentalis,A deep root system makes this tree useful for abating soil erosion. Has a high tolerance for urban conditions. Bark and berries are edible and have a variety of medicinal uses including treating sore throats and jaundice.
acer rubrum,Has become one of the most popular choices for street trees in America following concerns about the invasiveness of the Norway maple and the decline of the American elm due to the Dutch elm disease. Much of this popularity owes to the fact that they are highly adaptable in a wide range of environments
acer griseum,"Most easily identified by its showy bark, which exfoliates in thin, paper-like layers. Another identifying characteristic, which is noted in the scientific name (stemming from the latin word for grey, griseus), is the grey color found on the underside of leaves. Originally native to China, but was brought first to England in 1899 and shortly afterwards to the US."
aesculus x carnea,"Notable for producing large, showy, red-pink flowers up to 10” in size which are highly attractive to hummingbirds, making this a great choice for those looking to support pollinator-friendly environments."
celtis reticulata ,"Berries and seeds produced by this tree are edible and have been historically consumed by Native Americans residing in Southwestern portions of the US. Commonly used for native plantings, and is notable for its tolerance to droughts."
cornus mas ,"Produces bright red, cherry-like fruits, which are commonly used across Europe for fruit preserves, pies, and syrups. The vibrant, jewel-like coloring of its fruits inspired this tree to be named after the gemstone cornelian."
magnolia x soulangeana,"Most noted for its showy flowers, which can reach up to 8” across and produce a lovely fragrance, making this one of the most popular choices for deciduous magnolias. Sensitive to extreme high-low temperature changes, which may forecast higher risk to fluctuating temperatures brought on by climate change."
platanus x acerifolia,"Originally popularized for its tolerance to urban pollution in London (hence the common name). Also notable for its unique bark, which exfoliates in patches of green, gray, and brown, and its rapid growth rate."
quercus variabilis,Originally native to Eastern Asia and most commonly utilized for the production of cork.
tilia americana,"Flowers are extremely effective for attracting bees, and the Linden honey produced from bees visiting this tree is highly prized for its rich flavor. Other human uses for this tree include using the flowers to make tea and the sap to produce syrup."
ulmus parvifolia ,"An extremely resilient tree notable for its ability to resist both Dutch elm disease and the elm leaf beetle, as well as a variety of stressful urban landscapes."
ulmus pumila,"Highly invasive across North America due to its ability to adapt to a wide variety of environments and conditions, including Dutch elm disease. Its spread was further encouraged by wind-dispersed seeds, resulting in highly dense thickets which deter access by wildlife. It is currently highly discouraged from planting due to its invasive nature, as well as susceptibility to the elm leaf beetle and brittle, weak wood quality."
acer nigrum,"An Ohio native, used similarly to sugar maples for maple syrup and timber production."
carpinus caroliniana,"Additional common names ironwood and musclewood describe the unique texture of this tree’s trunk and branches, which take on the appearance of muscles. Wood is known for its horn-like smooth texture when polished and was used by early settlers to make bowls and tool handles. Native to Ohio and the Eastern US."
celtis laevigata,"Characterized by juicy, sweet fruits popular among birds. Unfortunately is commonly plagued by nipple gall, which results from insects called psyllids feeding on tree sap and a resultant leaf pocket developing as a defense mechanism around the insect."
fraxinus pennsylvanica,"Prior to the appearance of the emerald ash borer, this tree was known as one of the hardiest American ashes. Today, however, its vastly decreased range is now limited to areas not yet dominated by the ash borer."
cercis canadensis,"Name originates from the Greek word for weaver’s shuttle, kerkis, which was thought to be similar in appearance to the tree’s seed pods."
populus deltoides,"One of the largest and fastest growing trees found in North America and native to Ohio. Leaves are known to be very high in protein, with a higher amino-acid content than many popular grains such as rice and wheat. "
ulmus americana,"An extremely hardy species which can, in optimal conditions, live for several hundreds of  years."
nyssa sylvatica,"An excellent tree for attracting bees. Also produces edible, sour fruits which are popular among birds and other wildlife."
taxodium distichum,"Notable for producing 'knees', or stubby growth appearing around the base of the tree. These are thought to help bring air to the tree’s roots and help with stabilization in swampy conditions."
sassafras albidum,"Nearly all parts of the plant can be utilized for human consumption, as discovered by early Native Americans. Has been used to treat wounds and reduce fevers, among several culinary uses."
quercus velutina,"Part of the red oak group and typically reaches a height of 50-60'. Can be differentiated from the red oak by dark, nearly black bark on mature trees and large, hairy buds."
amelanchier laevis ,"This Ohio native features sweet, juicy, edible berries high in iron, copper, and vitamin C, and similar in taste to blueberries. "
fraxinus quadrangulata,"Identify this form of ash by feeling its angular, square stems. Common name is derived from its inner bark, which can be used to produce a blue dye, as well as its sap, which turns blue when oxidized. "
quercus alba,"Mature trees can be identified by their distinictive light-colored bark, which often flake vertically higher up the tree. Acorns are consumable by both wildlife and humans, but require a leaching process before consumption for humans. "
quercus bicolor,"A highly adaptable native species capable of living in a variety of environments, sometimes for up to 350 years. Acorns are a major food source for wild birds. "
quercus shumardii,"One of the largest native oak species. Performs well in urban environments due to its ability to adapt to variable conditions of drought and heat, heavy soils, and changes in pH. "
syringa reticulata ,"An Asian native and the largest species of lilac, sought after for fragrant, cream-colored spring flowers."
ulmus minor,"Wood is known for its resistance to water decay, and has been heavily utilized in shipbuilding. Unfortunately, sensitivity to the Dutch elm disease has greatly reduced the number of this species over time. "
ulmus procera,"It is believed that all current day species are clones of a variation imported by Romans over 2,000 years ago. This lack of genetic variation is cited as the reason for the species' high susceptibility to Dutch elm disease. "
acer platanoides,"Often found in cities and parks due to its tolerance to urban conditions (variable drought and heat, pests, pollution). High adaptability has led to some varieties designated as invasive. Milky sap found in its leaves prevents consumption by many native insects. "
pinus sylvestris,The most widely distributed pine in the world. Identifiable by its flaky red-orange bark. 
thuja occidentalis,Foilage was utilized by Native Americans and early colonists to treat scurvy. Today is used for a variety of antiviral and antibacterial purposes including treating bronchitis and many skin infections.  
pinus nigra,"Utilized in the rehabilitation of sites disturbed by human activities such as strip mining, as it performs well even in polluted soils. "
aesculus pavia,"Bright pink-red flowers are popular for attracting hummingbirds and butterflies. Fruits contain high amounts of saponins, which act as a natural defense against pests like the leafminer. "
crataegus viridis,"High tolerance to urban environments and additionally provides a unique aesthetic to landscapes, with red-orange fruits in the winter and  white flowers in the spring. Fruit is edible, but seeds contain cyanide. Flowers are infamous for a scent some compare to rotting flesh. "
quercus montana,Closely related to the swamp chesnut oak. Acorns are noted to be among the sweetest of Eastern oaks.
